NAME

    Data::FormValidator::Filters::WikiTrim - Trim filter for wikitext
    fields

SYNOPSIS

      use Data::FormValidator::Filters::WikiTrim qw(wiki_trim);
    
      # Build Data::FormValidator profile
      my $profile = {
          'required' => [qw( subject body )],
          'field_filters' => {
              'subject' => 'trim',
              'body'    => wiki_trim(),
          },
      };

DESCRIPTION

    Data::FormValidator::Filters::WikiTrim provides a slightly different
    trim filter than the default. Rather than trimming all leading/trailing
    whitespace, we trim all leading blank lines and all trailing
    whitespace. In a wikitext field, leading spaces on the first line could
    be important so they need to be preserved (while leading blank lines
    aren't important and could be trimmed out).

METHODS

    wiki_trim()

      Returns a filter which trims leading/trailing whitespace in a manner
      more suitable for wikitext entry fields; leading blank -lines- are
      trimmed, as well as all trailing whitespace.

      This differs from the standard "trim" filter in that we're only
      trimming leading blank -lines- but leave any leading whitespace on
      the first line; those leading spaces may be important.
